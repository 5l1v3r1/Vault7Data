Anti-Sandboxing: Wait for Mouse Click
Overview
The Trojan Upclicker (as reported by eEye) uses the SetWindowsHookExA API with the WH_MOUSE_LL parameter to wait until the user lets up the left mouse button (WM_LBUTTONUP) before performing any malicious functionality (then it injects into Explorer.exe).
A sandbox environment that does not mimic mouse actions (probably most of them) will never execute the malicious behavior. This is probably effective against Kaspersky and others.

So, uh, I tried to copy this so I could move the copy over to Detecting and Bypassing Personal Security Products (PSPs)  , but it won't let me move it.  Can one of y'all fine RDBers do me a solid and move it over?  Thanks!
