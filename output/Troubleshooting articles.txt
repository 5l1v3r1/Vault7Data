OS X supports SDK-based development.  This means that you can compile binaries for old versions of OSOperating System X on new versions of OSOperating System X.  Here's an example of how a Makefile might use this feature:
 
SDK_VER ?= 10.8
SDK_PATH := /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX$(SDK_VER).sdk
CFLAGS += -isysroot $(SDK_PATH)
LDFLAGS += -Xlinker -syslibroot -Xlinker $(SDK_PATH) -Xlinker -macosx_version_min -Xlinker $(SDK_VER)
